# Pipeline for aDNA - genotyope likelihood calling and pseudohaploid calling

Things matters for aDNA:
- deamination, C to T/U mutation
- low sequencing depth
- others (to add)

Before doing this, remember to perform data QC first.

## 1. Genotype likelihood





## 2. pseudohaploid calling
